        <h2>Welcome to Los Angeles County</h2>
        <p>Home to ten million people, with over 30,000 children in County Care and a shortage of foster parents. Over the past year, policy makers and attorneys, caseworkers and former foster youth, hackers and tech executives, banded together to attack the problems faced by child welfare systems across the nation. Our story map provides a brief tour of #HACK Foster Care events. Feel free to visit the event home pages as you travel. The Los Angeles event site includes video testimonies, code samples, and open data.</p>
